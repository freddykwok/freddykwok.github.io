This is a blog to record my developing workflow.

I am a newbie to software developing and also an amateur one. That means I have a long way to go. There are plenty of developing workflow out there, Continuous integration/delivery, DevOps, frontend, backend. There are many to learn and it is easy to lost track.

In the sea of information, the best way to keep track of thing is to write it down. Normal, you would like to write it down in some personal note taking app such as OneNote or Evernote. 

This blog will record how to use various API, third party services in web/iOS/Android Development. I would focus in iOS app development in the beginning and then expand to web then Android.

You would see the list of app/services I use to help with my developing workflow and API I am going to teach myself in the [**Apps**](), [**APIs**]() and [**Services**]() pages.
